What is GTD?
------------

GTD abbr for "Getting Things Done" -- is a framework for organizing and
tracking your tasks and projects. Its aim is to make you have 100% trust in a
system for collecting tasks, ideas, and projects.

The lists you have to maintain:

* `In`
* `Next actions`
* `Waiting for`
* `Projects`
* `Some day/maybe`

The `in` list
-------------
The `in` list is where you capture all your ideas whenever they occur to you.
This can be anything and process is just emptying your brain and putting it
into the `in` list.

#### Processing the `in` list
The items in the list should processed one by one in the order they appear on
your list.

Ask **is it actionable** --> if No, then throw it away if you don't need it
anymore or move to "some day/maybe list" or **incubate** it --> add it to
_tickler file_.

if Yes, Plan the next action that needs to be performed. Spend a little extra
time planning how the things need to be executed (If the action takes less
than two minutes to perform then just do it). If more than 2 minutes delegate
to the `Next Actions` list or move to `Waiting for` list if it depends on
something. `Next Actions` is probably the place where most of the things will
land up.  If the open loop will take more than one action to close, the overall
goal should also be noted on a `Projects` list.

The `Next Actions` list
-----------------------
The `next actions` list contains the list of things that you plan to perform.
This can also be said as **as-soon-as-possible actions**. Things which you will
work on whenever free.

The `Waiting-for` list
----------------------
The `Waiting-for` list contains the list of things that would be list of task
you are waiting on somebodies action.

`Projects`

I had some really great time in `Flock <http://flocktofedora.com/>`_ this year. This was my first Fedora event as
well as Flock. I reached Prague on 5th August (Day 0) at afternoon. After a quick nap, I
went out to the lobby and met `threebean <http://threebean.org/>`_, `stickster <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pfrields>`_ and `toshio <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Toshio>`_
.Later, in the evening `rtnpro <http://www.rtnpro.com/>`_ and i roamed around the place, Dejvick√°.

Day 1 started with the opening note by Fedora Project Leader, `Matthew Miller <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/MatthewMiller>`_
. The keynote was given by `Gijs Hillenius <http://flock2014.sched.org/speaker/Gijs>`_, he explained on how Free and Open
Source Software was accepted in the European Union. He spoke about the steps
and the contributions of the people in this regard. Later that day i attended
talk by `Pravin Satpute <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PravinSatpute>`_  who gave a talk on the fonts in Fedora. Next I attended
the talk by `Matthias Clasen <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mclasen>`_  on "Where's Wayland" followed by the talk on
"Wayland Input Status" by `Hans de Goede <http://hansdegoede.livejournal.com/>`_ . Hans gave a nice introduction of
supporting the various input in different devices on Wayland. The things to support the devices is way too complex but the team behind has been doing a great job. Then Anish and `Mike <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mfabian>`_ gave a talk on prediction based on input and context. Next I gave a talk on `Open Communication and Collaboration Tools for humans <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMYnxaexmk4>`_. rtnpro and i spoke on the roadmap of `Waartaa <http://www.waartaa.com>`_ and what we achieved till date.

After the event, we all went over to "The Pub" and had mugs of beer.

Day2 started with `pingou <http://blog.pingoured.fr/>`_ and `sochotnicky <https://github.com/sochotnicky>`_ giving a talk on the Fedora Review Server. `adimania <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Adimania>`_ later gave an awesome talk on Ansible. He talked on how fedora infra moved to ansible. He also shared the contribution oppurtunities.

The keynote by `Sean Cross <https://twitter.com/xobs>`_ talking about the Novena project. He explained on how
he built the laptop from scratch, future goals, how he popped with idea etc.

Later that day, I attended the talk by `Gergely Rakosi <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Rgeri77>`_
on "Rise of the Fedora Desktop: Gaming". I discussed with him the issues i faced with setting up Steam
on Fedora. He helped me resolving those issue and then we spent some time playing those games.

The evening we spent crusing on the river Vltava.

Day 3, I spent the first half hacking on Waartaa. Sadly, i missed the talked by
`Debarshi Ray <http://debarshiray.wordpress.com/>`_ on "GNOME: A Content Application Update".

During the second half, I roamed around the open spaces talking to people. Then attended the workshop
on fedmsg threebean. threebean showed us on how to hack around with `fedmsg <http://www.fedmsg.com/en/latest/>`_
. I
spent the time in the workshop going through the docs.

During the first half of Day 4, I spent some time hacking on Waartaa. After
lunch, I sat down with threebean to hack on fedmsg. Luckily got two merges in
the final hour of Flock

Really had fun meeting the Fedora contributors. Kudos to the organizing team of
